# Introduction

Vetta is a financial analysis engine designed to help analysts find meaningful information faster and produce better
investment insights. It focuses on ingesting, processing, and organizing both qualitative and quantitative data so users
quickly search and retrieve meaningful information.

## What it does

Given an earnings call recording, Vetta turns it into analysis-ready research material:

- Produces a clean, searchable transcript aligned to the recording
- Attributes statements to the correct participants (management vs. analysts)
- Organizes content by company and reporting period so it’s easy to browse and compare
- Enables natural-language querying to quickly surface relevant passages and themes
- Supports cross-call analysis across tickers, quarters, speakers, and recurring topics

## What it is not

Vetta is not a SaaS product, a cloud service, or a general-purpose transcription tool.
It is an opinionated, local-first pipeline designed for institutional financial research
where data confidentiality, reproducibility, and cost control matter.
